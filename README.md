🏆 Top Projects
---------------

###

Here are a few projects I'm particularly proud of:  
  
\- [Steamrush](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2647100/STEAMRUSH/) : a third-person Boss Rush game featuring fast-paced melee combat against unique bosses, punctuated by exploration segments that gradually unveil the captivating story of the isolated city-state of Haze.  

\- [MinimapMaker](https://github.com/DC20-dev/MinimapMaker) : MinimapMaker is my first Unity project. I worked on it while stuck in my bedroom because of COVID. When I'm not feeling my best I turn to this project to cheer me up with its relaxing mood and to remind myself that we can always make the best out of a tough moment.  

\- [Chip8 Emulator](https://github.com/DC20-dev/Chip8Emulator) : a barebones implementation of a Chip8 Emulator with minimal use of STL to allow maximum portability (I'm looking at you, Unreal Engine...😑)

\- [Chip8 Plugin](https://github.com/DC20-dev/Chip8-Plugin) : Unreal Engine 5 port of the Chip8 Emulator project using the .dll compiled library

\- [Brainfuck Interpreter](https://github.com/DC20-dev/brainfuck_in_python) : brainfuck interpreter implemented in python

\- [FAT16 Reader](https://github.com/DC20-dev/Fat16Reader) : python class that allows basic navigation of FAT16 formatted images

\- [PNG Viewer (python)](https://github.com/DC20-dev/python_simple_png_viewer) : python CLI tool that loads PNG files

\- [PNG Viewer (C)](https://github.com/DC20-dev/c_assignments/tree/main/png_viewer) : C implementation of the PNG viewer

\- [Raytracer](https://github.com/DC20-dev/rust_raytracer_series) : my personal implementation of a raytracer based on the famous "Ray Tracing in One Weekend Series" written in Rust

\- [bomb_engine](https://github.com/DC20-dev/bomb_engine) : bomb_engine is my attempt at building a versatile game engine using modern C++ and other languages such as Rust for tooling. It is in very early development stage but I think it showcases my competence and versatility as a programmer.
Writing a Game Engine is no easy task! 🤯
